    <pre style="font-size: 15px;"><h3><b><i>            Hi, I’m Bob Vila.

        I’ve spent my career helping people upgrade their homes and improve their lives.

        You probably know me from TV, where for nearly 30 years I hosted a variety of
        shows—This Old House, Bob Vila’s Home Again, Bob Vila, and Restore America
        with Bob Vila. Oh, and let’s not forget my cameo appearances on Tim Allen’s sit
        com, Home Improvement, where I got to star as myself. That was something else!</i></b></h3></pre>
        <pre style="font-size: 15px;"><h3><b><i>            Before my life in broadcasting, I launched my own residential remodeling and
        design business. Earlier still, I served as a Peace Corps volunteer, building houses
        and communities in Panama. I learned first-hand about home building from my 
        father, who built our family home by hand. I’ve written more than a dozen books
        about remodeling, buying your dream home, and visiting historic homes across
        America. It’s fair to say that buildings, especially homes, are my life’s work.</i></b></h3></pre>
        <pre style="font-size: 15px;"><h3><b><i>            Over the years I've supported many causes dealing with housing and architectural
        preservation. I've been actively involved with Habitat for Humanity and helped 
        them 'blitz build' a house in Yonkers, NY, which we put on TV. I worked for years
        with the National Alliance to End Homelessness, supporting the work of many 
        organizations throughout the country. In the last several years I've been helping
        out with the restoration of Ernest Hemingway’s home and collections at Finca
        Vigía near Havana, Cuba.</i></b></h3></pre>
